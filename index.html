<h3> Our belief </h3>
<p id="overview"> All humans, regardless of legal status, deserve a fair chance at life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Immigrants should not have to face fear and prejudices. Immigrants, both documented, and undocumented, are essential to our country and its' economy. Our diversity is what makes the United States great. </p>

<div id="divPage1">
  <h3>
    What's the controversy? </h3>
    <p id="ctext"> Many people have been lead to believe that immigrants and diversity don't benefit the country. People also believe that undocumented immigrants don't contribute anything to the country; However, this is not the case. Undocumented immigrants play a huge role in the economy, many immigrants take on jobs other Americans won't, like agriculture. Even though, they are part of the workforce and even pay taxes, they recieve little to no assistance from the government. Most people simply come for a better life, for their family and for themselves. </p>
    </div>
  
<div id="div2">

  <h3 id="whyt"> Why is this important? </h3>

  <p id="whyt2"> Humans are being mistreated each day simply for not having the privilege of being a natural born citizen in a certain country. In a first world country like the U.S, this should not be tolerated. Many people with authority or power abuse of it by giving detainees inhumane conditions. Prejudices against immigrants are too common. We cannot allow this to go on. </p>
